# PyTorch-AutoNEB

This framework implements AutoNEB (Kolsbjerg, Groves and Hammer, 2016) in PyTorch.
It finds low energy paths between minima of arbitrary loss/energy functions efficiently.

This framework was developed for neural networks, but is truely generic to any AutoNEB+Python application.
Several examples for neural network architectures are given.

## Implemented models/loss functions

The following neural network architecture's are included:

- simple CNNs and MLPs
- ResNets
- DenseNets

They can be applied on MNIST, CIFAR10 and CIFAR100.
